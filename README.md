# Vehicle and Pedestrian Detection Count
 Automated traffic analysis is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Traditional methods rely on background subtraction and handcrafted features, which struggle in complex scenes. Recent advances in deep learning particularly one-stage detectors like YOLO and two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN have dramatically improved detection accuracy and speed. In this work, we build a pipeline that not only detects and classifies vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks, pedestrians, others) but also tracks each instance to avoid double-counting and estimates its speed via pixel-to-real-world conversion.
